//
// A slip that arrived on its own, turned into something a person can say yes to.
//
// ─── WHERE THESE COME FROM ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// K PLUS and Krungthai NEXT save every slip into an album on the phone the
// moment a transfer goes through, with whatever was typed into บันทึกช่วยจำ
// printed at the bottom. The phone side watches the albums the person picked,
// reads each new picture with the same recogniser and the same rules as the
// scan screen, and hands the result to this file. What leaves here is a draft
// and two lines of words, never a row. Writing the row is still somebody's
// press; the only thing that changed is that the press can be on the
// notification instead of on the form.
//
// ─── WHY THE FILE'S CLOCK IS TRUSTED, AND HOW FAR ────────────────────────────
//
// A slip in a bank's album was saved by the bank's app when the money went, so
// the moment the picture was saved is the moment of the transfer. That settles
// the date on slips the recogniser cannot read a date off — on the first two
// tried, K PLUS's 11 came back as `Ti` and Krungthai's ต.ค. as `a.A.` — but
// only when the slip agrees: a time of day printed on it within a few minutes
// of the file's. A slip saved again from the bank's history a week later has a
// file a week newer than the money, its printed time will not match, and it
// waits for a person instead.
//
// When the slip has a date of its own, that one is used and the file only has
// to be within a day of it — a transfer at 23:59 saved at 00:01 is still the
// same transfer. Further apart than that is a slip saved long after the fact.
//
// ─── WHAT GETS ONE PRESS AND WHAT DOES NOT ───────────────────────────────────
//
// One press saves only what has nothing left to check: an amount the rules
// were sure of, a unit, a date that agrees with the file, and money that went
// to somebody else. Anything short of that opens the form already filled in,
// with the reason written on it. A wrong row that looks right is the one thing
// this feature could add to the ledger, and the button is missing exactly
// where that could happen.
//
// ─── THE CATEGORY IS TYPED AT THE BANK ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The memo is the only thing on the slip the person chose, so it is where the
// category comes from: "อาหาร ข้าวมันไก่" is food, with ข้าวมันไก่ as the note.
// No space is needed — "อาหารทดสอบ" is what was actually typed the first time.
// A memo that names no category is looked up against the notes already in the
// books, so ข้าวมันไก่ goes wherever ข้าวมันไก่ went last time.
